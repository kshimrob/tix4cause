  <h2>FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS ABOUT TIX4CAUSE</h2> 
  <p><strong>How does Tix4Cause Work?</strong></p>
  <p>1. Tix4Cause has partnered with a national ticket exchange so that millions of tickets from the secondary ticket market are available on its website. If you are interested in these tickets and want to view and/or purchase them, you will be directed off the Tix4Cause website to our trusted affiliate’s website. Prior to being transferred, you will be asked to provide your email and select a charity of your choice to benefit should you decide to purchase. If you do purchase tickets from our exchange partner, Tix4Cause will receive a portion of the service fees you pay for that particular transaction and Tix4Cause will donate 50% of what it receives for the transaction to the selected charity.</p>
  <p>2. Causes, charities, and non-profits can sign up as Tix4Cause members to receive even more benefits. As a Tix4Cause member, these organizations can receive and accept donations of tickets from individual and corporate donors and, if desired, use the Tix4Cause platform to post, market and sell these tickets. They can also utilize the platform to sell tickets to their own events. Membership is free and these organizations can receive up to 100% of the proceeds depending on the particular ticket type and transaction.</p>
  <p>3. Individuals and corporations can buy tickets on and through Tix4Cause. They can also donate tickets which they can’t use.  No sense wasting them and all it takes is filling out the “Contact Us” form and providing the relevant information – such as event name, date, location, venue, date, event time, number of tickets, seat information, etc.  Donors can choose their favorite Tix4Cause member organization to benefit.  If a 501(c) (3) organization is selected, once the ticket donation is verified and approved by Tix4Cause on behalf of the selected Cause Member, a donor will receive a tax acknowledgment letter from the selected Cause Member recognizing the generous donation.  Once verified, approved, and accepted the Cause Member is free to use the ticket donation as deemed necessary including utilizing the Tix4Cause platform to market and sell the tickets.
    </p>
  <p>4. When a purchaser selects a ticket owned and offered by a Tix4Cause Cause Member (Proprietary Ticket) the tickets may be sent to the buyer via a mobile device, via email, special delivery, or via Fed Ex.</p>
  <p>5. When a purchaser selects an exchange ticket to purchase, the purchaser is taken to our trusted affiliate and completes the transaction on the affiliate’s website. All affiliate transaction details are subject to the affiliate’s terms, conditions and rules.</p>
  <p>6. Tix4Cause makes prompt payment to the applicable Cause Member one calendar month following the date of the proprietary ticket purchase and within 30 days of receipt of earnings from an exchange ticket purchase.</p>
  <p><strong>Is Tix4Cause, LLC a registered 501(c) (3) Non-Profit Organization?</strong></p>

We believe in reinvesting our profits into our cause members as well as our business in order to feed the hungry, help the environment, shelter the homeless, assist the veteran, find the cures, and improve the community.</p>

  <p><strong>DONORS</strong></p>
  <p><strong>Is my donation tax-deductible?</strong></p>
  <p>Tix4Cause makes no representation as to whether a donation to a designated charity is tax deductible.  We advise all donors to consult a tax advisor to determine whether a deduction is allowable. Once your ticket donation is accepted on behalf of the selected cause, a letter from the applicable charity is sent to you to document your donation.  This letter will not include the value donated. The amount you claim as a tax deduction is your decision.</p>
  <p><strong>What happens to donations if they don’t sell?</strong></p>
  <p>While we make every effort to work with the selected cause to market the tickets that are posted on our website, we cannot guarantee or make any warranty that every ticket donated to a cause on tix4cause.com will sell. We work with the receiving cause to market the offering through their support base as well. Please note: once you have donated your ticket on tix4cause.com, and the ticket donation is verified and accepted, the ticket becomes the property of the cause. You will receive your tax receipt whether the ticket sells or not.</p>
  <p><strong>As a donor, how should I price my donation?</strong></p>
  <p>To ensure a dynamic marketplace, Tix4cause recommends you price your tickets or experiences at the price charged by the original source.  All pricing decisions remain within the complete discretion of the selected cause.</p>
